## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



## Getting and Cleaning Data 
## Week 1

#Content

Data collection

Raw files (.csv,.xlsx)
Databases (mySQL)
APIs

Data formats

Flat files (.csv,.txt)
XML
JSON

Making data tidy

Distributing data

Scripting for data cleaning


#About the course

- finding and extracting raw data
-tidy data principles and how to make data tiny
-practical implementation through a range of R packages

raw data -> processing script -> tidy data -> data analysis -> data communication


you need to organize the data into a tidy format before analyzing it.

#RAW and PROCESSED DATA

Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.

qualitative : country of origin, sex, treatment

quantitative : height, weight,  blood pressure

blood measure is measured by calculating the pressure measurement.

* raw data may only need to be processed once

*processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming, etc.

*there may be standards for processing

*all steps should be recorded


## Components of Tidy Data

the raw data

a tidy data set

a code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set

an explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2 -> 3

#Tidy data

each variable you measure should be in one column

each different observation of that variable should be in a different row

there should be one table for each "kind" of variable

if you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that allows them to be linked

-- 

include a row at the top of each file with variable names

make variable names human readable AgeAtDiagnosis instead of AgeDx

in general data should be saved in one file per table



# The code book

information about the variables including units, in the data set not contained in the tidy data

information abotu the summary choices you made

information about the experimental study design you used

---

a common format for this document is a Word/Text file

there should be a section called "Study design" that has a thorough description of how you collected the data

there must be a section called "Code Book" that describes each variable and its units


# The instruction list

ideally a computer script in R, but Python is ok too

the input for the script is the raw data

the output is the processed, tidy data

there are no parameters to the script

---

in some cases it will not be possible to script every step, in that case you should provide instructions like:

step1 : take the raw file, run version 3.1.2 of summarize software with parameters a = 1, b = 2, c = 3

step2 : run the software separately for each sample

step3 : take colum three of outputfile out for each sample and that is the corresponding row in the output data set
