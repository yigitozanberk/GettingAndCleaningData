## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Week 4

Editing text variables

regular expressions

working with dates

#Editing text variables

a very common data cleaning step. extra spaces, commas, etc.

```{r}
cameraData <- read.csv("./data/cameras.csv")

names(cameraData)

tolower(names(cameraData))
#to avoid errors in the future. you might forget the uppercase details

splitNames = strsplit(names(cameraData), "\\.")#for location.1
#\\. because period is a reserved character
splitNames[[5]]

splitNames[[6]]
#it has split into two names

mylist <- list(letters = c("A", "b", "c"), numbers = 1:3, matrix(1:25, ncol = 5))

head(mylist)

mylist[1]

#to remove all periods

splitNames[[6]][1]

firstElement <- function(x) {x[1]}
sapply(splitNames, firstElement)
#then you can store it in a new vector and get to names of the variables

#it works because:

splitNames #is a list.

reviews <- read.csv("./data/reviews.csv")
solutions <- read.csv("./data/solutions.csv")

head(reviews, 2)

sub("_", "", names(reviews), )
#whereever you find an underscore, replace it with "" (nothing)

testName <- "this_is_a_test"

sub("_", "", testName)
#removes only one

gsub("_", "", testName)
#removes all




```



```{r}
#finding values grep() grepl()

grep("Alameda", cameraData$intersection)

#grep takes a string, and searches for it in the intersection variables. 

table(grepl("Alameda", cameraData$intersection))

#creates a logical vector of where the string appears

#used for subsetting
cameraData2 <- cameraData[!grepl("Alameda", cameraData$intersection), ]

#intersections without Alameda


grep("Alameda", cameraData$intersection, value = T)

#value = T makes grep return the values where the serach string appears

grep("JeffStreet", cameraData$intersection)

length(grep("JeffStreet", cameraData$intersection))

#nice way to check and see if a particular value appears in a vector

library(stringr)

nchar("Jeffrey Leek")

#returns number of characters

substr("Jeffrey Leek", 1, 7)

paste("Jeffrey", "Leek", sep = ",")

str_trim("Jeff      ")
#trims of excess space




```


#names of variables should be 
- all lower case when possible
-descriptive(diagnosis versus Dx)
-not duplicated
-not have underscores or dots or white spaces

variables with character values
-should usually be made into factor variables(depends on application)
-should be descriptive(use TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1 and Male/Female versus 0/1 or M/F)


## Regular Expressions

regular expressions can be though as a combination of literals and metacharacters

literals <- matches exactly. obama, obama, obama. not Obama, or oBama

we need to express whitespace word boundaries, sets of literals...

some metacharacters represent the start of a line.

# ^i think 

will match all expressions beginning with this expression

i think my car...
i think i love...
i think this mor....

# morning$

represents the end of the line

.... had something this morning
...had the morning
....morning


we can list a set of characters we will accept at a given point in the match

# [Bb][Uu][Ss][Hh]

will match the lines

..... "Name the worst thing about Bush!"
..... desert creosote bush, brownies, BBQ chicken
.... and bushwalking at molonglo gorge
Bush told you that north...
I'm listening to Bush - Hurricane (Album)

and will match all.



then, you can start combining

# ^[Ii] am

will match:

i am so angry at my....
i am boycotting....
I am twitt...
I am a very....


you can specify a range of letters or characters. the order doesn't matter

[a-z] or [a-zA-Z]

# ^[0-9][a-zA-Z]

will match the lines

7th inning..
2nd half.....
3am.....
5ft 7 sent....
1st sign.....


# [^?.]$              
here we're looking at the end of the line($). we're looking for any line that ends in anything that ends with anything other than a period or a question mark.

i like basketballs
6 and 9
dont worry... we all die anyway!
Not in Baghdad
helicopter under water? hmm




"." is used to refer to any character.

# 9.11 

will match the lines

its stupid the post 9-11 rules
if any 1 of us did 9:11 we would b
169.114.677
sings : 0009911975


"or" metacharacter

# flood|fire

will match:

is firewire like usb...
the global flood...
it will match fire or flood


# flood|earthquake|hurricane|coldfire
you can include up to any number of alternatives

alternatives can be real expressions 

# ^[Gg]ood|[Bb]ad

here we are searching good at the beginning of the line, or bad in anywhere of the line

# ^([Gg]ood|[Bb]ad)

here the expression both has to be in the beginning


# [Gg]eorge( [Ww]\.)? [Bb]ush
question mark indicates that the indicated expression is optional

i bet i can spell better than george bush 
BBC reported that George W. Bush claimed
a bird in the hand is worth two george bushes

you have to add the backslash before the dot. otherwise the code accepts it as a metacharacter. you have to excape with the \ operator before the dot.

* and + signs are metacharacters used to indicate repetition: * means "any number, including none, of the item" and + means "at least one of the item"

# (.*)

will match the lines

anyone wanna chat?(24, m, germany)
hello, 20.m here... ( east area + drives + webcam)
(he means older men)
()


[0-9]+ (.*)[0-9]+

at least one number, followed by any number of characters followed by at least one number again

working as MP here 720 mp battallion, 42nd birgade
so say 2 or 3 years
it went down for like, 3 or 4 days
mmm its time 4 me 2 go 2 bed


we can use { and } as interval quantifiers : they let us specify the minimum and maximum number of matches of an expression

[Bb]ush( +[^ ]+ +){1,5} debate

will match the lines

Bush has historically won all major debates he's done.
in my view, Bush doesn't need these debates..
bush doesn't need the debates? maybe you are right
That's what Bush supporters are doing about the debate.

bush, at least one space, followed by something that's not a space, followed by at least one space, I wanna see that between one and five times. we want to see something like space word space. up between one and five times.


m,n ->means at least m but not more than n matches
m ->means exactly m matches
m, ->means at least m matches

# \1 and \2 refers to previous expressions in parantheses

 +([a-zA-Z]+) +\1 +

means: we're looking for is a space followed by some-at least one but possibly more characters, followed by at least one space, followed by the exact same match that we saw within the paranthesis, followed by at least one space

night night twitter!
blah blah blah
my tattoo is so so itchy today

in short, it searches for repetitions

* is greedy so it always matches the longest possible string that satisfies the regular expression

^s(.*)s
-> we're starting at the beginning of a string and we're looking for an s followed by characters, followed by s.
matches the whole expressions down there

sitting at starbucks 
setting up mysql and rails
studying stuff for the exams


to make it less greedy

^s(.*?)s$

->? changes the greediness. it does not try to findthe maximum length of the string


##Working with Dates

```{r}
d1 <- date()

d1

d2 <- Sys.Date()

d2

class(d2)


```

formatting dates

%d <- day as number(0-31)

%a <- abbreviated weekday

%A <- unabbreviated weekday

%m <- month(00-12)

%b <- abbreviated month

%B <- unabbreviated month

%y <- 2 digit year

%Y <- 4 digit year

```{r}

format(d2, "%a %b %d")

format(d2, "%A %B %d")

x <- c("1jan1960", "2jan1960", "31mar1960", "30jul1960")

z <- as.Date(x, "%d%b%Y")

z

z[1] - z[2]

#getting number from date difference
as.numeric(z[1] - z[2])

weekdays(d2)

months(d2)

julian(d2)

library(lubridate)

ymd("20140108")
#year, month, day

mdy("08/04/2013")
#month, day, year

dmy("03-04-2013")
#day, month, year


ymd_hms("2011-08-03 10:15:03")
#year day month, hours minutes seconds

ymd_hms("2011-08-03 10:15:03", tz = "Europe/Istanbul")

?Sys.timezone

TZ <- Sys.timezone()

x <- dmy(c("1jan2013", "2jan2013", "31mar2013", "30jul2013"))

wday(x[1])

wday(x[1], label = T)



```
