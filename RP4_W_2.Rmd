## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##mySQL
www.mysql.com

data are structured in
-databases
tables within databases
fields within tables

data are linked in different data frames with specific value columns

install mysql

install.packages("RMySQL")

```{r}
ucscDb <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = "genome", host = "genome-mysql.cse.uscs.edu")

result <- dbGetQuery(ucscDb, "show databases;")
dbDisconnect(ucscDb)#disconnecting is crucial when working with MySQL servers.

hg19 <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = "genome", db = "hg19", host = "genome-mysql.cse.ucsc.edu")

allTables <- dbListTables(hg19)

length(allTables) #10949 tables. the advantage of mySQL

allTables[1:5]

dbListFields(hg19, "affyU133Plus2")

dbGetQuery(hg19, "select count(*) from affyU133Plus2")

#counts all the records on the table

affyData <- dbReadTable(hg19, "affyU133Plus2")
head(affyData)

query <- dbSendQuery(hg19, "select * from affyU133Plus2 where misMatches between 1 and 3")
#data is usually too big in mySQL so you need to 
# select the data you need

affyMis <- fetch(query)
quantile(affyMis$misMatches)

affyMisSmall <- fetch(query, n=10) #only bring top 10 records

dbClearResult(query) #you need to stop the query from that server.

dim(affyMisSmall)

dbDisconnect(hg19)

# REMEMBER TO CLOSE CONNECTION as soon as you don't need it anymore







```

## do not delete, add, or join things from ensembl. only select

in general be careful with mysql commands

#HDF5

used for storing large data sets

hierarchical data format

groups containing zero or more data sets and metadata

datasets multidimensional array of data elements with metadata

www.hdfgroup.org

```{r}
install.packages("biocLite")
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("rhdf5")

library(rhdf5)
created = h5createFile("example.h5")
created

created = h5createGroup("example.h5", "foo")
created = h5createGroup("example.h5", "baa")
created = h5createGroup("exmaple.h5", "foo/foobaa")

h5ls("example.h5") #lists the groups created

A = matrix(1:10, nr = 5, nc = 2)
h5write(A, "example.h5", "foo/A")

B = array(seq(0.1, 2.0, by = 0.1), dim = c(5,2,2))

attr(B, "scale") <- "liter"

h5write(B, "example.h5", "foo/foobaa/B")

h5ls("example.h5")

df = data.frame(1L:5L, seq(0, 1, length.out = 5), c("ab", "cde", "fghi", "a", "s"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

h5write(df, "example.h5", "df")
h5ls("example.h5")


readA = h5read("example.h5", "foo/A")
readB = h5read("example.h5", "foo/foobaa/B")
readf = h5read("example.h5", "df")
readA

h5write(c(12,13,14), "example.h5", "foo/A", index = list(1:3, 1))
h5read("example.h5", "foo/A")

## READING FROM THE WEB

scraping data out of websites, and APIs, and authentications

webscraping: programatically extracting data from the HTML code of websites

attempting to read too many pages too quickly can get your IP address blocked

http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HI-I6C0AAAAJ&hl=en

```{r}
con = url("http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HI-I6C0AAAAJ&hl=en
")

htmlCode = readLines(con)

close(con)


library(httr)
content2 = content(html, as="text")

parsedHtml = htmlParse(content2, asText = TRUE)

xpathSApply(parsedHtml, "//title", xmlValue)



```

#Accessing websites with passwords

```{r}
pg2 = GET("http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/passwd", authenticate("user", "passwd"))

pg2

# using handles

google = handle("http://google.com")
pg1 = GET(handle = google, path = "/")
# you won't have to authenticate over and over again thanks to the cookies by using handles.




```


#Reading from APIS

application programming interfaces

places to download data
which users are tweeting, what are they tweeting about.

you can get theese by GET requests

you need HTTR package for this.

you need to create a developers account to be able to do this

myapp = oauth_app("twitter", key = yourConsumerKeyHere, secret =yourConsumerSecretHere)

sig = sign_oauth1.0(myapp, token = yourToken, token_secret = TokenSecret)

homeTL = GET("https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/home_timeline.json", sig)

twitter only supports json at the moment.


json1 = content(homeTL)
json2 = jsonlite::fromJSON(toJSON(json1))
json2[1, 1:4]

how do you know what url to use

go to the documentation for the twitter api

url and parameters there. you can send those parameters to the API

httr allows GET, POST, PUT, DELETE if you are quthorized

you can authenticate with a user name or a password

httr works well with facebook, google, twitter, githb, etc..

# READING from other sources

google 'data storage mechanism R package'
like ' MySQL R package'

functions to interact directly with files:
file - open a connection to a text file
url
gzfile
bzfile
?connections for more info

'foreign' package
loads datafrom Minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Systat

basic functions read.foo

ex : read.arff, read.dta, etc..

RPostresSQL
RODBC
Rmongo



reading images

jpeg, readbitmap, png, EBImage(Bioconductor)

rdgal, rgeos, raster

reading music: tuneR, seewave
